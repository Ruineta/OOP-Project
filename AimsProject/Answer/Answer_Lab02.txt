Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: Java does not allow this because both constructors would have a single String parameter, which would cause ambiguity. If you create a constructor that accepts a String for the title and another constructor that also accepts a String for the category, Java cannot determine which constructor to call. To solve this problem, you could either:
1. Use a different parameter type apart from String for category.
2. Use a different parameter order if there are multile parameters.
